# Usage & [Features](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/wiki#features)
A list of all features can be found [here](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/wiki#features).
The LaF is compatible with Java >=1.8 (you need >=1.9 to get proper scaling).

You can find all property values on [weisj.github.io/darklaf-docs](https://weisj.github.io/darklaf-docs/)

This project is available on Maven Central:
### Maven
````xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.weisj</groupId>
  <artifactId>darklaf-core</artifactId>
  <version>2.7.0</version>
</dependency>
````
### Gradle
````kotlin
implementation("com.github.weisj:darklaf-core:2.7.0")
````

You can also use the latest nightly build.
````kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
    }
}

configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy.cacheChangingModulesFor(0, "seconds")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.weisj:darklaf-core:latest.integration")
}
````

## Installation
The LookAndFeel can be easily installed using the `LafManager`
````java
// For default theme (IntelliJ)
LafManager.install();
````
````java
// Specify explicit theme.
LafManager.setTheme(new IntelliJTheme());
LafManager.install();
````
````java
// Directly install theme
LafManager.install(new DarculaTheme());
````

For more information see the [wiki](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/wiki/LafManager#setting-the-theme).

**Note**: The recommended method is using the `LafManager` as it automatically handles reloading the ui. 

### Choosing a theme
It is highly encouraged to provide users more than one theme. Forcing users to use a light/dark theme because of personal preferences might be degrading their experience in certain situations. 
For the visually impaired darklaf provides a set of high contrast themes, `HighContrastThemeLight` and `HighContrastThemeDark`.

Darklaf supports detecting the system theme on macOS and Windows with the ability to automatically change the theme if the settings change.

````java
// This returns the preferred theme of the system settings.
LafManager.themeForPreferredStyle(getPreferredThemeStyle());
````

The following settings are picked up by darklaf:

| Windows                   | macOS                   | Setting             |
|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------|
| :ballot_box_with_check:   | :ballot_box_with_check: | Light/Dark mode     |
| :ballot_box_with_check:   | :ballot_box_with_check: | High contrast mode  |
| :ballot_box_with_check:   | :ballot_box_with_check: | Accent color        |
|                           | :ballot_box_with_check: | Selection color     |
| :ballot_box_with_check:   |                         | Font size           |

You can use the `ThemeSettings` class with `ThemeSettings#showSettingsDialog` or `ThemeSettings#getSettingsPanel` to provide the user
the most possible customization.

## Example
````java
import com.github.weisj.darklaf.LafManager;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;

public class DarklafDemo {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
            LafManager.install();

            JFrame frame = new JFrame("Darklaf - A themeable LaF for Swing");
            frame.setSize(600, 400);

            JButton button = new JButton("Click here!");

            JPanel content = new JPanel();
            content.add(button);

            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
            frame.setContentPane(content);
            frame.setVisible(true);
        });
    }
}
````

All custom component-variants and settings can be enabled by setting the appropriate client
property of the component.
They can be found [here](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/wiki/Features#alternative-visualsbehaviour-for-components).

This LookAndFeel supports custom window decorations (only on Windows at this point). In contrast to most other LaFs the native window behaviour is not compromised giving a seamless experience that still looks native.

## Extensions
Check out the [darklaf-extension project](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf-extensions) for additional artifacts which add
support for some third-party projects.

# Build

    ./gradlew build

When building on Windows, you need a C++ toolchain installed to build native extension.

When building on macOS you need to have XCode (or the command line tools) installed to build the native extension.

If you want to build for platforms different from your machine the necessary binaries are automatically downloaded.
For this you have to specify a valid GithubAccessToken using `githubAccessToken` property in your local `gradle.properties` file.
The access token only needs to have the permission to read repositories.

You can also manually download the respective native libraries
from the latest successful run of the [Build Native Libraries Action](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+Native+Libraries%22+branch%3Amaster) and place it in the corresponding `<variant>/libraries` folder.
This is necessary if you don't have the appropriate toolchain installed, but you machine is a binary target. 

**Note**: You can still build the project without the libraries, but then custom decorations won't be supported.

# Contribute
Here is a list of things that currently are not finished or need refinement. This list is a work in progress and being updated regulary. If you find any problems with the LaF feel free to submit an issue:

- [Native window decorations on Linux.](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/issues/2)
  * See [/windows](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/tree/master/windows) for the Windows implementation.
  * See [/macos(https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/tree/master/macos) for the macOS implementation.
- Localization:
  * Theme preferences panel. [here](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/theme_settings.properties)
  * Other properties:
      * [Windows title pane](https://github.com/weisJ/darklaf/blob/master/windows/src/main/java/com/github/weisj/darklaf/platform/windows/ui/WindowsTitlePane.java)
        This also needs to have a bundle created in the first place.
