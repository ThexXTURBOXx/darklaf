/**
 * A specialized layout manager for {@link JLayer} in combination with the {@link TransformUI}.
 * <p>
 * It extends {@link DefaultLayerLayout} and, as long as no enabled {@link TransformUI} is set to
 * {@link JLayer}, will act exactly the same as its super class.
 * <p>
 * However, when the above conditions are all true, its behavior becomes different:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instead of setting the view's size to the layer's calculated inner area, it will set the
 * view's size to its preferred size.
 * <li>Instead of setting the view's bounds to the calculated inner area, it will center the view in
 * that inner area. This may result in some parts of the view formally obscured, or, some parts of
 * the inner area not covered by the view.
 * <li>The preferred size will first be computed by the super implementation. Then, before
 * returning, the calculated size will be transformed with the {@link AffineTransform} returned by
 * {@link TransformUI#getPreferredTransform(Dimension, JLayer)};
 * <li>The minimum size will first be computed by the super implementation. Then, before returning,
 * the calculated size will be transformed with the {@link AffineTransform} returned by
 * {@link TransformUI#getPreferredTransform(Dimension, JLayer)};
